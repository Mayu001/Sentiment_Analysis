I visited this restaurant thinking itâ€™s open till late, so that I can pick up Briyani and go home. But the restaurant was not open, and no one answered my call as well. Utterly disappointed.
This is almost my 5th time having a completely satisfying experience
Chicken was grilled to perfection and with a thick mayonnaise they offer it went really well .
Not a place you can take your family too.
Went here for a lunch. Firstly the staffs were very patient and kind. Their introduction was appreciatable.
Food is not very tasty.
I have always considered barbecue nation to be the best (affordable) choice when it comes to bbq buffets in Chennai.
Standard menu and has a good flavors,Starters are good, Service is next level, they make us comfortable.
Food quality was quite awful. Biriyani didn't just taste bad, it was not what you would call hyderabadi style biriyani.
The place has a descent ambiance and good service. The staff is very courteous and the food is delicious.
The place was very unclean. The staffs really lack in hygiene,Just because I entered inside, I Ordered a chicken shawarma and a Sharja Milkshake. Both tasted very worse.
Tuscana Pizzeria! Proved to be one of the best pizza makers in chennai, got a chance to try it out through the dineout GIRF18.
I must say this has been the worst experience of Italian food that I have ever had.
Had gone there few months back , ordered 3 pizzas , all three were extremely thin and were not at all tasty.
I ordered chicken lasagne which costed Rs.715 and received a spoiled food which was totally food poisoned stuff and they delivered lik 2.5 hours later only
